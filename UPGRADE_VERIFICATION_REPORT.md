## Applied Modifications

### 1. User Limits Configuration (APPLIED)
**File:** `py/core/base/providers/base.py`
```python
# Production-scale user limits
default_max_documents_per_user: Optional[int] = 10_000        # Was: 100
default_max_chunks_per_user: Optional[int] = 100_000_000      # Was: 1,000,000
default_max_collections_per_user: Optional[int] = 1_000       # Was: 100
```
**Impact:** Enables handling of large-scale production workloads
**Test Status:** ⚠️ Verified in code, blocked by dependency issue in test

### 2. LLM Request Timeout (APPLIED)
**File:** `py/core/base/providers/llm.py`
```python
request_timeout: float = 800.0  # 800 second timeout for long operations
```
**Impact:** Prevents premature timeout on complex LLM operations
**Test Status:** ✅ Verified operational

### 3. Database Connection Timeout (APPLIED)
**File:** `py/core/providers/database/base.py`
```python
connect_timeout=120,  # 120 second connection timeout
```
**Impact:** Improves reliability for database connections
**Test Status:** ✅ Verified operational

### 4. HNSW Vector Indexing (APPLIED)
**File:** `py/core/providers/database/chunks.py`
```sql
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_vectors_vec_hnsw 
ON {table} USING hnsw (vec vector_cosine_ops)
```
**Impact:** Significant performance improvement for vector similarity searches
**Test Status:** ✅ Verified operational

### 5. Enhanced File Error Handling (APPLIED)
**File:** `py/core/providers/file/postgres.py`
- Improved large object error handling
- Better cleanup in failure scenarios
- Enhanced exception handling for undefined objects
**Impact:** More robust file operations with better error recovery
**Test Status:** ✅ Verified operational

## Modifications NOT Applied (Reasons)

### Architectural Improvements (16 files)
**Reason:** Latest R2R incorporated these changes through superior architectural approaches
**Examples:**
- Provider system restructuring → New provider architecture is more advanced
- Database schema updates → Latest schema includes these improvements
- Error handling patterns → Standardized across latest codebase
- Configuration management → Enhanced configuration system implemented

### Deprecated Features (Several components)
**Reason:** Latest R2R deprecated or replaced these with better implementations
**Examples:**
- Old authentication methods → New auth system implemented
- Legacy API endpoints → Replaced with standardized endpoints
- Outdated database patterns → Modern patterns adopted

## Test Results Summary

### Core Component Testing
| Component | Status | Details |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| LLM Provider (800s timeout) | ✅ PASS | Timeout configuration active, requests handle properly |
| Database Provider (120s timeout) | ✅ PASS | Connection timeout implemented, pool working |
| HNSW Vector Index | ✅ PASS | Index created successfully, performance improved |
| File Error Handling | ✅ PASS | Enhanced error handling operational |
| AppConfig User Limits | ⚠️ BLOCKED | Code verified, test blocked by mailersend dependency |

### Integration Testing
- **Database Connectivity:** ✅ Operational
- **Vector Operations:** ✅ Enhanced performance verified
- **File Operations:** ✅ Robust error handling confirmed
